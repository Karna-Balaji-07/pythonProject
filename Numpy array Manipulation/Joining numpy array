Numpy provides various functions to combine arrays. Few of them are :
 >> np.concatenate
 >> np.stack
 >> np.block

 np.concatenate() : the concatenate function joins two or more arrays along the specified axis
 by default the value of axis is set to 0. we can change it to 1 if we want to join arrays along the row
