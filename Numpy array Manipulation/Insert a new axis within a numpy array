NumPy provides us with two different built-in functions to increase the dimension of an array i.e.,

1D array will become 2D array
2D array will become 3D array
3D array will become 4D array
4D array will become 5D array

There are various ways to add a new axis to a numpy array :
>> using np.newaxis()
>> using np.expand_dims()
>> Simultaneous insert many axes in the array
>> using numpy.reshape()
