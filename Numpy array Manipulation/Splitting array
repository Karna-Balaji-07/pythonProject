Array splitting in NumPy is like a slice of cake. Think of each element in a NumPy array as a slice of cake. Splitting divides this “cake” into smaller “slices” (sub-arrays), often along specific dimensions or based on certain criteria. We can split horizontally, vertically, or even diagonally depending on our needs.


The split(), hsplit(), vsplit(), and dsplit() functions are important tools for dividing arrays along various axes and dimensions. These functions are particularly useful when working with one-dimensional arrays, matrices, or high-dimensional datasets. NumPy’s array-splitting capabilities are crucial for enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of data processing workflows.

Axis: The dimension along which the array is split (e.g., rows, columns, depth).
Sub-arrays: The smaller arrays resulting from the split.
Splitting methods: Different functions in NumPy for splitting arrays (e.g., np.split(), np.vsplit(), np.hsplit(), etc.).
Equal vs. Unequal splits: Whether the sub-arrays have the same size or not.

There are many methods to split array :
>> np.split()
>> np.array_split()
>> splitting numpy 2d arrays
>> np.vsplit()
>> np.hsplit()
>> np.dsplit()

numpy.split() is a function that divides an array into equal parts along a specified axis. The code imports NumPy creates an array of numbers (0-5), and then splits it in half (horizontally) using np.split(). The output shows the original array and the two resulting sub-arrays, each containing 3 elements.


numpy.array_split() splitting into equal or nearly equal sub-arrays or is similar to numpy.split(), but it allows for uneven splitting of arrays. This is useful when the array cannot be evenly divided by the specified number of splits. numpy.array_split(array, 4) splits the array into four parts, accommodating the uneven division.
