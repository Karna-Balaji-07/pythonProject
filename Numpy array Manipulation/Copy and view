The main difference between copy and view is that the copy is the new array whereas the view is the view of the original array. In other words, it can be said that the copy is physically stored at another location and view has the same memory location as the original array.

No Copy: Normal assignments do not make the copy of an array object. Instead, it uses the exact same id of the original array to access it. Further, any changes in either get reflected in the other.

View: This is also known as Shallow Copy. The view is just a view of the original array and view does not own the data. When we make changes to the view it affects the original array, and when changes are made to the original array it affects the view.

Copy: This is also known as Deep Copy. The copy is completely a new array and copy owns the data. When we make changes to the copy it does not affect the original array, and when changes are made to the original array it does not affect the copy

To check whether array own itâ€™s data in view and copy we can use the fact that every NumPy array has the attribute base that returns None if the array owns the data. Else, the base attribute refers to the original object.
