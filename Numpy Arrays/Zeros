The numpy.zeros() function returns a new array of given shape and type, with zeros.

numpy.zeros(shape, dtype = None, order = 'C')

shape : integer or sequence of integers
order  : C_contiguous or F_contiguous
         C-contiguous order in memory(last index varies the fastest)
         C order means that operating row-rise on the array will be slightly quicker
         FORTRAN-contiguous order in memory (first index varies the fastest).
         F order means that column-wise operations will be faster.
dtype : [optional, float(byDeafult)] Data type of returned array.

ndarray of zeros having given shape, order and datatype.
