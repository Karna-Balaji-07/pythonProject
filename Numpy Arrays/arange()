The arange([start,] stop[, step,][, dtype]) : Returns an array with evenly spaced elements as per the interval. The interval mentioned is half-opened i.e. [Start, Stop)

start : [optional] start of interval range. By default start = 0
stop  : end of interval range
step  : [optional] step size of interval. By default step size = 1,
For any output out, this is the distance between two adjacent values, out[i+1] - out[i].
dtype : type of output array


Array of evenly spaced values.
Length of array being generated  = Ceil((Stop - Start) / Step)
